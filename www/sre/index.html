            Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies them to infrastructure and operations problems. The main goals are to create ultra-scalable and highly reliable software systems. 
            According to Ben Treynor, founder of Google's Site Reliability Team, 
            SRE is "what happens when a software engineer is tasked with what used to be called operations

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p align="right">
            Site Reliability Engineering was created at Google around 2003 when Ben Treynor was hired 
            to lead a team of seven software engineers to run a production environment. The team was 
            tasked to make Google's sites run smoothly, efficiently, and more reliably. 
            Early on, Google's large-scale systems required the company to come up with new paradigms on 
            how to manage such large systems and at the same time introduce 
            new features continuously but at a very high-quality end user experience. 
            The SRE footprint at Google is now larger than 1500 engineers. 
            Many products have small to medium sized SRE teams supporting them, 
            though not all products have SREs. The SRE processes that have been honed over the years are 
            being used by other, mainly large scale, companies that are also 
            starting to implement this paradigm. Zomato, Intuit, ServiceNow, 
            Microsoft, Apple, Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox, Amazon, Target, 
            Dell Technologies, IBM, Xero, Oracle, Zalando, Acquia, VMware, GitHub, Waze, 
            Home Depot, Capital One, OVH, and Ticketmaster have all put together SRE teams.
